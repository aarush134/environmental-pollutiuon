            Environmental pollution means making the natural world dirty or harmful. It happens when things like smoke, garbage,
            chemicals, or loud sounds get into the air, water, or land and make them unsafe. Most pollution is caused by
            peopleâ€”factories, cars, burning trash, cutting down trees, and using too much plastic are common reasons. There are
            different kinds of pollution: air pollution makes the air dirty, water pollution harms lakes and rivers, and land
            pollution comes from throwing waste on the ground. Pollution is bad for animals, plants, and people. It can cause
            sickness, kill animals, and make the Earth hotter. To stop pollution, we can throw garbage in bins, use less plastic,
            ride bicycles, save water, and plant trees. Everyone must help protect the Earth by keeping it clean. A clean
            environment means a better, healthier life for us now and for future generations.
