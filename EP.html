            <p>Pollution is severely impacting human civilization by harming health, the environment, and the economy. Air pollution
                leads to respiratory diseases, heart problems, and even cancer, while water pollution causes deadly illnesses and
                contaminates drinking sources. Soil pollution reduces food quality, affecting nutrition and health. Pollution is
                also a
                major driver of climate change, resulting in extreme weather, rising sea levels, and natural disasters that displace
                communities and damage infrastructure. Ecosystems are being destroyed, leading to biodiversity loss, which in turn
                affects agriculture and natural balance. Economically, billions are spent on healthcare and disaster recovery. Poor
                and
                vulnerable populations suffer the most, deepening inequality and reducing quality of life. Pollution not only
                shortens
                life expectancy but also contributes to mental health issues due to constant exposure to toxic environments. If not
                controlled, pollution will continue to weaken the foundations of civilization and threaten the future of humanity.üåç‚ö†Ô∏è</p>
