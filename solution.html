            To reduce pollution, we can make small changes in our daily lives. First, we can use less plastic by choosing reusable
            bags, bottles, and containers. Recycling helps reduce waste and keeps harmful materials out of landfills. Using public
            transport, biking, or walking instead of driving can cut down on air pollution. Planting trees helps clean the air and
            provides homes for animals. Saving water by turning off taps when not in use also helps conserve our resources. Reducing
            energy use by turning off lights when not needed or using energy-efficient appliances can help lower pollution too.
            Additionally, supporting clean energy sources like solar or wind power can reduce the burning of fossil fuels. By making
            these changes, we can protect our environment and help reduce pollution for future generations.
