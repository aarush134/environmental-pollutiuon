            Pollution has many bad effects on both humans and nature. Breathing dirty air can cause problems like asthma, coughing,
            and other breathing issues. Water pollution harms fish and other animals, making rivers and oceans unsafe for both
            animals and people. It can also spread diseases. Soil pollution makes it harder for plants to grow, which affects food
            production. Noise pollution from loud sounds like traffic or factories can cause stress and even damage hearing.
            Pollution also harms animals and plants, killing them or making it hard for them to survive. As pollution increases, the
            Earth’s climate changes, causing extreme weather like heatwaves and floods. All of this makes our environment less
            healthy and harder to live in. Pollution affects the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land where we live.
            It’s important to reduce pollution to protect our planet and health.

            Pollution harms both the planet and the people living on it. Dirty air can make it hard to breathe, leading to health
            problems like coughing or asthma. Polluted water can harm fish, plants, and even humans who drink it. It can also make
            swimming or fishing dangerous. When the soil is polluted, it becomes harder for plants to grow, which can reduce food
            supplies. Too much noise from traffic and factories can cause stress, sleep problems, and even hearing loss. Pollution
            also hurts animals and plants, making it harder for them to live and survive. In the long run, pollution causes changes
            in the weather and increases natural disasters like storms or droughts. Overall, pollution makes the Earth less clean
            and healthy, which affects everyone—humans, animals, and the environment.
